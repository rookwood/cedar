# Cedar
## Information management for audiology programs

Managing students' clinical grades across multiple locations and preceptors can be quite challennging.  This can be 
further complicated by wanting to ensure that grades accurately reflect actual performance and are not inflated by sentiment.
Cedar aims to provide a clear solution to this by helping to ditch the mess of spreadsheets used across clinical programs and
to make grading easy and transparent.  

This product is under active development, and feedback is welcomed.
